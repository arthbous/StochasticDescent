# Stochastic Descent Algorithms

The goal of this repository is to minimize a non-convex function F(x).

The idea is to add a Gaussian noise to a descent algorithm in order to converge to the global minimum. Three algorithms are coded Gradient Descent with noise, Moment 1 (Langevin), Moment 2. To learn more about these algorithms please look at *Algorithms.pdf*.

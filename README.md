# Stochastic Descent Algorithms

The goal of this repository is to minimize a non-convex function F(x).

The idea is to add a Gaussian noise to a descent algorithm in order to converge to the global minimum. Three algorithms are coded  :
1. Gradient Descent with noise
2. Moment 1 (Langevin),3.
3. Moment 2.
